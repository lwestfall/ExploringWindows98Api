# Exploring the Windows 98 API

This repo journals my exploration into the Windows 98 API. I am addicted to old hardware and software, and I want to learn how old Windows programs were written. I've realized early on that so much of the Windows API from Windows NT still exists in Windows 11.

A lot of the code in here will be nearly character-by-character from the book, _Windows 98 Programming From The Ground Up_ by Herbert Schildt, but I do intend to start deviating once I get to a critical mass of understanding.
